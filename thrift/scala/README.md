There are few sbt thrift plugins:
* <https://github.com/twitter/sbt-thrift>
* <https://github.com/bigtoast/sbt-thrift>
* <https://twitter.github.io/scrooge/SBTPlugin.html>

But they are too old and required thrift is very old.

I copy the generated java file from the same helloworld.thrift  into this project and  it can be used in Scala.
